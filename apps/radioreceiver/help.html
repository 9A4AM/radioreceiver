    <p class="what">
      An application to listen to radio transmissions from your browser using a

    <h1 name="what_is_this">What is this</h1>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver is an HTML5 webpage that uses an RTL-SDR USB stick to
      digitize radio signals. Then, it demodulates those signals on your
      computer and plays the resulting audio through your computer's speakers or
      headphones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most RTL-SDR sticks let you receive signals in any frequency between 30
      and 1700 MHz. This includes interesting radio bands like FM radio, marine
      radio, air band (airplanes and airports), weather radio, amateur radio,
      police and other emergency services, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also listen to frequencies below 30 MHz using an upconverter or
      some sticks' "direct sampling mode". These frequencies include AM radio,
      shortwave radio, HF amateur radio, and numbers stations, among others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Radio Receiver can demodulate stereo FM, AM, narrowband FM, USB, and LSB.
      It has adjustable bandwidth filters so you can also listen to Morse code
      transmissions or challenging, distant stations.
    </p>

        Radio Receiver needs to run in a browser that supports the HTML5 USB
        API. Generally, this means a Chromium based-browser (Chrome, Edge,
        Opera) on a computer or on an Android device.

      Radio Receiver was written to work with an RTL-2832U-based receiver with a
      R820T tuner chip (or compatible). This hardware configuration is a little
      dated, but we are planning to add support for newer sticks very soon.
    </p>

    <h1 name="how_to_use">How to use Radio Receiver</h1>

    <h2 name="how_sdr_works">How SDR works</h2>

    <p>
      Traditionally, radios were built entirely out of hardware such as
      oscillators, filters, or mixers. All these components were designed to
      tune into a particular frequency band and demodulate a particular type of
      signal, and modifying a radio to receive a different signal could be hard
      or even impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The modern approach to radio is &ldquo;Software-Defined Radio&rdquo;
      (SDR), in which the hardware doesn't do everything anymore; instead, it
      now does the minimum and leaves most of the processing to a computer
      running specialized software. SDR systems are flexible (changing the
      signals they can receive is as simple as changing their software) and
      cheap, because the same hardware designs can be used for many different
      types of radio signals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your RTL-SDR stick is a European Digital TV receiver. It contains a
      microprocessor that runs a program that demodulates radio signals,
      extracts a video stream, and sends it to your computer. However, it is
      possible to configure the stick so that, instead of decoding the signals,
      it will send them to your computer. Radio Receiver will then receive those
      signals and demodulate them in a JavaScript program on your browser.
    </p>

    <h2 name="tuning">Tuning, bandwidth, and sample rate</h2>

    <p>
      When you tune your RTL-SDR stick into a frequency, you don't only receive
      signals in that exact frequency. Instead, you receive signals in a
      &ldquo;band&rdquo; of frequencies centered on the one you tuned into. The
      difference between the lowest and highest frequencies in the band is the
      &ldquo;bandwidth&rdquo;.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the RTL-SDR stick digitizes the signals in that frequency band, it will
      send &ldquo;samples&rdquo; to the computer. The number of samples it sends
      per second is the &ldquo;sample rate&rdquo;, which is mathematically tied
      to the bandwidth: 1 million samples per second give you 1 MHz of
      bandwidth, 2 MHz require 2 million samples per second, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Higher sample rates give you larger bandwidths and more signals you can
      &ldquo;see&rdquo; at once; on the other hand, they require more processing
      power on your computer. With RTL-SDR sticks, the sample rate is
      adjustable, but Radio Receiver currently sets it to about 1 million
      samples per second, for 1 MHz of bandwidth.
    </p>

    <h2 name="interface">The user interface</h2>

    <p>
      You can see the Radio Receiver interface in the figure below. There are
      three parts to it, from top to bottom: the spectrum scope, the waterfall,
      and the bottom bar.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-spectrum></rr-demo-spectrum>

    <h3>The spectrum scope</h3>

    <p>
      The spectrum scope represents the frequency band that Radio Receiver is
      tuned into. The left side shows the lower frequencies and the right side
      shows higher frequencies. The line on the top shows which frequency
      corresponds to each part of the scope; in this example, they go from 93.4
      MHz on the left to 94.4 MHz on the right, with 93.9 in the center.
    </p>

    <p>
      The yellow line &ldquo;dancing&rdquo; in the scope shows the power of the
      radio signals that were received on each frequency: the higher it gets,
      the more power. By watching this line, you can see the radio signals that
      are present in the frequency band. In this example, you can see three
      powerful signals on 93.5, 93.9, and 94.3 MHz, and a weak signal on 94.1
      MHz.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the left, a decibels scale helps you gauge the relative power of the
      signals and the noise.
    </p>

    <h3>The waterfall</h3>

    <p>
      The spectrum scope shows you the signals that are being received
      <i>right now</i>, but the waterfall lets you see what signals were
      received in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      The waterfall scrolls down slowly, showing more recent signals on the top
      and less recent ones on the bottom. On each line, the intensity and color
      of each pixel corresponds to the power received for its frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the waterfall to see if there are regular transmissions on
      other neighboring frequencies, and their characteristics. With enough
      practice, you can even tell what kind of transmission it is, and you could
      even make a good guess at what they are saying!
    </p>

    <h3>The bottom bar</h3>

    <p>
      The bottom bar has two parts. The first one lets you adjust the decibel
      ranges for the spectrum scope and the waterfall. You can edit the values
      directly, or you can drag the two sliders to the right and left, closer
      together or farther apart.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you drag the sliders, you will see changes in the dB scale on the left
      of the spectrum scope, and you will also see that the colors in the
      waterfall will become different to represent the new range.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second part of the bottom bar lets you zoom in to see a particular
      part of the frequency band in more detail. You can click the magnifier
      with a &ldquo;plus&rdquo; sign to zoom in, or with the &ldquo;minus&rdquo;
      sign to zoom out, or you can type your zoom level directly in between
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are zoomed in, you can scroll left and right using the scrollbar
      that appears on the right.
