      <h1 slot="header">What is this?</h1>
      <p>In few words: an HTML5 web-based RTL-SDR stereo FM radio receiver.</p>
      <p>
        In more words: this webpage can use
        <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/"
          >a cheap USB digital TV receiver</a
        >
        to capture radio signals, do FM demodulation in the browser, and play
        the resulting audio signal through your computer's speakers or
        headphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called SDR (Software-Defined Radio) because all the radio signal
        processing is done by software running in the computer, not by specially
        built hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <em>not</em> streaming radio.
        <strong
          >You must plug an RTL-SDR receiver into your computer's USB port to
          use this webpage.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>An RTL2832U digital TV receiver with an R820T or R820T2 tuner.</li>
        <li>A browser that supports the HTML5 USB API.</li>
        <li>
          Windows: use <a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</a> to install a
          WinUSB driver for the RTL2832UHIDIR/RTL2832U device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Linux: you may need to disable the
          <code>dvb_usb_rtl28xxu</code> driver.
        </li>
        <li>Mac, ChromeOS, and Android: it should work out of the box.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Plans</h1>
      <p>This webpage will be updated to support modern RTL-SDR devices.</p>
      <p>
        It will also be updated to provide the type of UI that people have come
        to expect of RTL-SDR software, with a waterfall, multiple modulation
        schemes, etc.
      </p>
